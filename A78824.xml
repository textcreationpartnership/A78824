         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>JF proportionably to the griefe we have conceived at your letters; wherein you have expreſſed the moſt ſad face of your affaires) we had but as much ability either by our conſolations to aſſwage your ſorrowes, or by our counſels to eaſe your burthens, or by any our co-operation to help your extremity: we ſhould think our ſelves very happy in ſo well correſponding with your honourable and moſt loving compellation of us: and right glad we ſhould bee thus to requite you with our beſt and effectuall good offices. But alas, as the ſcantneſſe of our capacity in this kind; ſo the ignorance of the more inward cauſes of ſo many miſeries, and chiefly the perplex &amp; dangerous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ature of matters now in agitation among you: All theſe put together, ſtrike us quite dumb: we are as men who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ly at a ſtand, able only (in a kind of ſilent aſtoniſhment or holy horrour) to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, and to adore that finger of God, which is now lifted up over you all.</p>
            <p>But ſince, being by you ſo lovingly invited to it, we muſt needs at laſt break off our ſilence: We are reduced to an extraordinary Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence both of Minds and of Pens, what to ſay firſt or laſt, or indeed what to ſay at all.</p>
            <p>And now in the end, after long deliberation, leaſt, as <hi>Jobs</hi> friends, we ſhould tranſgreſſe by precipitate or unſeaſonable diſcourſe: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold our hearts and mouths top-full of the Sences and Expreſſions
<pb facs="tcp:113977:3"/> of our hearty commiſeration, our eyes running down with teares of compaſſion, our breaſts even ſwoln up with ſighes &amp; groans at your calamities. Theſe are they, God is our Witneſſe, that fill up the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of our private prayers, of our publike Devotions, Faſtings, and Humiliations: In all which we are reſolved to give the Father of mercies no reſt, untill your tranquility being once more ordained in Heaven, God do <hi>extend peace upon Earth unto you all like a River, &amp; the fulneſſe of his Bleſſing, like an ever-flowing ſtream.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our affaires, yea the generall intereſt of all the reformed Churches are ſo cloſely involved in yours, and ſo mutually depending thereon, That your ſafety once procured, aſſures us all of our own good E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates.</p>
            <p>Therefore, eſpecially during this grievous Tempeſt, which may ſeem to bring about again the heavie times of the Saints great primitive Tribulation, we are, in a manner, compelled with trembling hearts and lips, to powre out our lamentations into the eares of our moſt gracious and heavenly Father, no longer now only preparing to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend by Fire,</hi> as he once revealed it in a Viſion to his Prophet <hi>Amos, Amos</hi> 7.4, 5. but already for a long time really <hi>contending by Fire</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: And how then can we forbear from crying out? <hi>O Lord for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, ceaſe we heſeech thee, by whom ſhall</hi> Jacob <hi>ariſe, for he is ſmall, and round about all in a flame, by the fire of thy burning indignation.</hi> From this our own Watch-Tower, untoucht as yet by Divine miracle: We have beheld this furious conflagration, ſpreading it ſelf all over; We have ſeen the <hi>Griſoen-Italian Churches</hi> utterly defaced, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel in <hi>Bohemia</hi> its ancient Seat, wholly extirpated; the <hi>Palatinate</hi> devoured; the <hi>French Churches</hi> deprived of all humane ſupports &amp; refuges (like ſo many poor little Callow Birds, alive indeed, but only during pleaſure the) <hi>German Churches</hi> almoſt all over-ſhaken; yea, more then half deſtroyed, your own <hi>Ireland</hi> ſwallowed up with an unexpected deluge of <hi>Aſſaſſines</hi> and <hi>Robbers,</hi> one onely thing was wanting to that huge heap of publique calamity; namely, that <hi>flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing England (the very eye and excellency of all the Churches, Chriſts own choice, purchaſe, and peculiar; the Sanctuary of the afflicted, the Arceonall of the faint-hearted, the Magazine of the Needy, that Royal Standard of good hope) ſhould by ſo unlookt for an accident, without an externall Enemy, or forraign Impreſſion, become in a manner its own Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo de ſe, and make an end of its ſelf with its own cruell hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:113977:4"/>
            <p>What a ſad ſpectacle is this to ſee that Church thus trodden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot? To ſee that glorious Fould of our Lord thus ranſackt, yea worryed, not by the wild Beaſts of the Forreſt, not torn in pieces by the mercileſſe pawes of the Lyon, or of the Woolf, but utterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred by its own unnaturall ſheep inraged and exaſperated one againſt another.</p>
            <p>An horrid example this, and till now never heard nf among the reformed Churches.</p>
            <p>It ſeemes, heretofore, like Chriſts own true ſheep, they were kept tame by the feare of God, united by the ſame bond of Faith, knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the apprehenſion of the common enemy: and ſo long they did both expreſſe and exerciſe holily and faithfully their mutuall charity, quiet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and unity amongſt themſelves: in all which, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved themſelves from the rage of the Wolfe by the Chriſtian ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of their own conditions, by the innocency of their pious lives, by the ſanctity of their Religion, by the conſtant undantedneſſe of their holy Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But now we are wholly ſtruck with horrour at the change of that ſo glorious Face of your Church, whileſt we hear at this diſtance the loud report of thoſe deadly wars that are now flaming up between the King and his People: to ſee at Daggers drawing indeed, Brethren againſt Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, Parents againſt their own Children, Chriſts ſheep puſhing againſt and goring their own Fellowes, nay their own Shepheards: At all this we are utterly amazed, and would ſcarce have believed, that in the ſelf-ſame pitched field, one and the ſame God and Father, in the name of one and the ſame Mediator, at one and the ſame time, could be invocated for help on both ſides, to ſhed the bloud of thoſe, that for the Major-part had hitherto by ſo many clear Demonſtrations in the whole equall courſe of their lives, equall in their Piety towards God, equall in their love and loyalty towards their Country, approved themſelves ſuch faithfull and true Brethren one to another. Strange, that theſe ſhould now againſt their own Bowels, turn all their wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>like power, far better if imployed in the juſt puniſhments of their own treacherous Neighbors, or towards the relief of their deareſt Brethren ſo long bowing the back under the weight of their bondage, and even at the laſt gaſp for help.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What marvell then, if theſe your cruell diſtractions have awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; yea, divided even to a variety the judgments and affections too of Chriſtendome?</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:113977:4"/>
            <p>Neither do we our ſelves deny but that for a while we did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſtagger at, and as it were fluctuate about it; yet that demur of ours did neither proceed from prejudice againſt, nor from partiality towards either ſide, as not being called upon by either, neither pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely nor privately, till now of late in your reference unto us, which we do reckon as no ſmall piece of honou, ſince in your eſteeme, our judgment may ſeeme of ſo much weight, as able to advance or bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance down either party, both being of ſuch extraordinary quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>We have contained our ſelves within the bounds of a conſciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble judgment, and impartiall charity towards both parties, for indeed we are both Brethren; We have neither way exceeded the compaſſe of our own meaſure, but ſtill kept a mean, as rejoycing on the one hand at thoſe good things which we did heare were entertained with the generall applauſe of all good men; So on the other hand, we could not but behold with griefe thoſe other Siniſter paſſages that in themſelves did carry a more fatall appearance.</p>
            <p>We were overjoyed at the iſſue of the Scottiſh troubles, that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at firſt to preſage a combuſtion, not unlike this of yours, and yet far ſooner quenched, for as by Gods own admirable handy-work (So by the never-enough-magnified of your moſt gracious King, &amp; by the Concord of that wary Nation) that fire was in time put out, ere it did burſt into a more open flame.</p>
            <p>At the firſt report of theſe your own Commotions, our mindes were poſſeſſed with a good hope that all paſt offences might with the ſame promptitude and facility be forthwith repaired, and all matters compoſed.</p>
            <p>So that what actions or counſels ſhould appear amiſſe, might by the benignity of the beſt of Princes be eaſily redreſſed, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently both Church and Common-wealth without noiſe or bloud ſhed, be kept in due order<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>In purſuance of all which, we could not but admire the happy and glorious beginnings of the Parliament, and the more then Fatherly affection of his moſt gracious Majeſty, evidenced by his enacting thoſe Lawes, from which for the time to come, there was a cleare hope of a Government full of equity, and freed from all corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</p>
            <p>An example not ſo rare, as indeed ſingular in this our wild Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,

But all theſe our goodly hopes were ſoone blaſted by that raging ſtorme and tempeſt of popular tumults among you, that did force away both your moſt gracious Prince from his Parliament, as alſo a great part of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament from it ſelf. Since which we have heard indeed of many at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts and enterpriſes, many Propoſitions and Projects, but all of them come to nothing, nothing is yet brought to perfection, nothing is yet rightly ſetled or eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>The buſineſſe of the Church might ſeem the chief object of your care and ſollicitude: If it had been handled and debated at times, &amp; with mindes calm and quiet: had the oppoſite judgments been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and impartially weighed one with another; ſuch an orderly courſe might happily have purchaſed a laſting Peace to your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and alſo rendred unto your Church that moſt deſired Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive face of the Apoſtolicall times:<note n="a" place="margin">Such was Epiſcopacy in its firſt Apoſtolical vigour of Diſcipline &amp; Government, the which as at the Synode of <hi>Dort</hi> this very man did both acknowledge unto Biſhop <hi>Carlton</hi> to bee the beſt Form of Church-Government, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo did heartily wiſh for it in his own Church; ſo doth he ſufficiently commend the happy ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of it above pag. <hi>5.</hi> in that full paſſage of his conteining the Superlative Praiſes of the former flouriſhing eſtate of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as before theſe troubles it ſtood under <hi>Epiſcopacie:</hi> The Reſtauration of which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer good Eſtate, is again by this Author at the latter end of this Epiſtle, pag. <hi>12.</hi> earneſtly wiſhed and prayed for.</note> but behold how quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the event hath fallen out? for the mindes of both ſides being averſe from, yea, violently bent one againſt another, this very matter hath proved the great rock of offence by exaſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the wound, and tearing it wider and wider, * by diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more and more aſunder the hearts of each party, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered enough already through former partiality and diſcord of affections. Nay, if the report be true, theſe <hi>Church Diſtractions</hi> have opened a wide gap to ſo many boyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and private ſpirits, which we hear have aſſumed to themſelves the moſt miſchievous Title of Independents, then which Deſtructive Sect nothing could more undermine, yea quite overturne the very foundation of the Church.</p>
            <p>Beſides all that, we have bin extreamly grieved at this, That the <hi>ſpirit of diviſion</hi> hath ſo plentifully ſown among you his pernicious <hi>Tares</hi> of <hi>Feares and Jealouſies,</hi> that they have not onely fructified, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

That all that curſed fuell thus hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped on, is now at laſt kindled into <hi>bloody warre,</hi> lengthned on both ſides by a multiplication <hi>of deadly feuds,</hi> So that during ſuch an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal combuſtion, <hi>what ever mens bare words, &amp; never ſo frequent Proteſtations other wiſe may pretend, yet the Royall Honour, Power and Dignity, cannot but fall into utter contempt: and on the contrary, the licentiouſneſſe of the moſt audacious and lawleſſe, cannot but gather ſtrength, and out-grow the other:</hi> and then conſequently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Piety muſt needs decay, mutual love and charity muſt needs vaniſh away; and in ſtead thereof, <hi>a kind of ſavage diſpoſition,</hi> yea brutiſh rage muſt <hi>needs invade at laſt the minds and maners of the men of this Generation,</hi> who in proceſſe of time will no longer look upon the old originall cauſes that began the warre, but rather upon the new mutuall injuries freſhly done, or received in the very progreſſe or proſecution of the war between two parties divided, far more by an odious difference of reproachful Names, as it were, infamous brands fixed upon each other, then really by the cauſe it ſelf. It had been farre more eaſie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, and all good men elſe, to deliver our judgements upon your caſe: had the Major part of either ſide differed from the other, either in the more eſſential poynts of Religion, or elſe diſſented about the Fundamental Lawes of the Common-wealth: or had either party been oppreſſed<note n="b" place="margin">Wo be to them that firſt began that warre whoſe <hi>Non-neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> yea <hi>Injuſtice</hi> ſtrangers themſelves can ſo far off ſo plainly perceive and condemne too.</note> by the other in a direct way of open perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or had there been an introduction of publick tyranny againſt the lawes through the baſeneſſe and puſillanimity of the other party: But as for you, you have abundant cauſe of comfort or ſecurity againſt all theſe evils.<note n="c" place="margin">To wit, in a faire, quiet, legall Parliamentary way, not in a Martiall way: therefore he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions not at all the power of Armes, but onely the power of the Lawes.</note> ſince by vertue of your own moſt juſt and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Lawes, <hi>thoſe Lawes that already have been indifferently agreed upon by the generall conſent of all parties concerned,</hi> you may with eaſe prevent, or put all thoſe forementioned evils which in other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes may ſeem almoſt unavoidable. All theſe conſiderations put together, have moved us for a long while ſeriouſly to deliberate and adviſe what might be at laſt, the beſt expedient left to procure
<pb facs="tcp:113977:6"/> 
               <hi>an honeſt and ſure Peace</hi> among you. Indeed wee have been much <hi>ſcandalized,</hi> that <hi>all the Mediations</hi> of ſeveral Kingdomes and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces in league with you, have been tried and uſed all in vaine: Howbeit it came into our mind to propound this <hi>one Medium more,</hi> whether now at laſt there be yet any hope to obtain from the <hi>Kings</hi> moſt gracious Majeſty, and from the <hi>Parliament,</hi> that, of both ſides, <hi>Eccleſiaſticall perſons</hi> may bee choſen of unqueſtioned Truſt, and Fame-proofe beyond all ſuſpition, to whom this great buſineſſe may be committed; Namely, that comparing the chiefe points now in controverſie, they may chalkout ſome good way towards an <hi>holy peace.</hi> But firſt theſe men muſt by Gods good Spirit themſelves be <hi>diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of all factious inclinations,</hi> that ſo they may become fit <hi>Vmpires and Truſtees</hi> of the publick Peace, and <hi>impartiall Embaſſadours of Reconciliation</hi> between both parties, and alſo able and ſtudious too by all their Speeches, Exhortations, and Sacred Obteſtations to charm the hearts that on both ſides are ſo obdurate in War and Bloodſhed.</p>
            <p>This were the ready way, by thus interpoſing the Sacred Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer in the very midſt of theſe publike flames, to quench all the heart-burnings: for who knowes whether at the devout Prayers and holy groanes of Perſons Sacred, thus proſtrate at the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoole of the Heavenly grace, the Divine power and glory may not break out once more, and ſhew forth it ſelfe by moving the hearts of both Parties to lay downe all hatred, and publike enmities? The onely way to procure ſuch ſound Councell of both ſides, and to purchaſe again the precious bleſſing of a generall Peace, is eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when all humane helps faile, to call in the Divine Aſſiſtance, which no man did ever try in vaine. By theſe good meanes that may be brought to paſſe (what cannot be hoped for from Civill Warre, however the ſucceſſe prove) that by a voluntary Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mindes, the wound ſhall be ſo fully cloſed up, as that Love and Charity may in time perfectly be recovered.</p>
            <p>The good opinion which you have conceived of us, may ſuffer us to offer theſe Conſiderations unto you. It might be immodeſty in us to preſcribe, or to adviſe you any further: But no Law of Modeſty can ever forbid us to wiſh, and to Vow, and to beſeech God for you, yea to appeale unto God, and to adjure you all in his Name.</p>
            <p>O then above all, take a ſpeedy and ſpeciall care for a ſure and
<pb facs="tcp:113977:6"/> found Peace, what ever it be<note n="d" place="margin">What would this <hi>Peace-maker</hi> have ſaid if he had ſeen or heard of <hi>ſo many Royall rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated offers of peace</hi> wherwith the Soveraigne hath and ſtill doth wooe his <hi>Stiffe-neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Subjects,</hi> Certainely, <hi>the more peaceable ſide</hi> hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt good men had the Reputation of the better ſide.</note> tis to be preferred before any Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Broyles.
